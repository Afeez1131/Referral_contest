# WHATSAPP REFERRAL CONTEST WEB APPLICATION
#1. INTRODUCTION.
According to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1176096/number-of-social-media-users-nigeria/), WhatsApp is the most popular platform used in Nigeria, with over 90 million users. Alot of small scale businesses are now capitalizing on this opportunity to increase their sales, since most of the people they want to sell to are now on this platform, but with a single problem, **CONTACTS**.

Business is a game of numbers, the higher the number of people seeing your adverts, the higher sale you are likely to make.

One of the ways of generating massive contact list for the business owners is by using Referral marketing tactics. With a referral contest, you can use the power of social marketing to effectively grow your brand, promote a new product, engage your customers, and make more sales.
