# WHATSAPP REFERRAL CONTEST WEB APPLICATION
# 1. INTRODUCTION.
According to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1176096/number-of-social-media-users-nigeria/), WhatsApp is the most popular platform used in Nigeria, with over 90 million users. Alot of small scale businesses are now capitalizing on this opportunity to increase their sales, since most of the people they want to sell to are now on this platform, but with a single problem, **CONTACTS**.

Business is a game of numbers, the higher the number of people seeing your adverts, the higher sale you are likely to make.

One of the ways of generating massive contact list for the business owners is by using Referral Contest marketing tactics. With a referral contest, you can use the power of social marketing to effectively grow your brand, promote a new product, engage your customers, and make more sales.

1. Raise brand awareness
2. Grow your contact list
3. Attract more customers 
4. Promote a new product or service
5. Engage your existing audience with Viral WhatsApp referral Giveaways & Contests.


# 3. PROGRESS.
After Launching the website in February, We have more than **20 business owners** who started a contest using this applications. The application has successfully referred over **800 contacts** to different WhatsApp based SMEs from different states in Nigeria.

# 4. HOW IT WORKS
**The applications work in 5 simple steps**
1. Business Owner create an account on the application.
2. Start a contest by entering the amount to be awarded to the person with the highest number of refers, select the starting date and time as well as the ending date and time.
3. The business owner will now share a pre-generated message to his/her contact to make them aware of the contest.
4. Interested individuals will click on the link attached to the generated message for the business owner to become a referral.
5. Referral can now invite people to vote for him/her with his/her unique link.

And at the end of the contest, all contact of participants including the Referrals and people referred can be exported as a **Contact File**.

# 4. FUTURE PLANS.
- Using the WhatsApp/Twitter API to handle all the process from the comfort of WhatsApp, So people do not have to leave any social media to start a contest, and we can present them with result on request also.
- Going global, the issue of SMEs taking their business to whatsApp is global, and them needing contacts is also a global issue, so there is future plan to take this global.
- Handling the disbursement of contest payment to the winners: right now, we are only hoping the business owners who create contest on our platforms will disburse rewards accordingly. In the future we plan on handling the disbursement of the payment to the winners directly.
- Make the UI UX much more better.
